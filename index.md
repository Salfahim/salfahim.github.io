### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

	Lab 5, part 2 was my favorite because I got to learn about the differences between US units and International units. I learned about different ways of separating fractional and integer parts. I also learned about the limits of the different data types in C++.

* Lab 10

	Lab 10, part 1 was my favorite because I got to learn about the vectors usage as well as two dimensional data structures. I also liked how we could map the data structure to a real-world use, such as California's country population. 

* Lab 11

	Lab 11, part 2 was my favorite because I dived deep into the object oriented programming. I learned how programs can be created in an object-oriented way, by dividing into classes. I also learned how to use random numbers and defining class functions in different file (other than header).
